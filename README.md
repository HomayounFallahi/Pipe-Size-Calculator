ðŸ“˜ Pipe Data Standards
----------------------

All pipe dimensional data in this application is based on **ANSI B36.10** and **ANSI B36.19**, in accordance with relevant **ASME codes**.  

The app includes data for **carbon steel** and **stainless steel** pipes. For other materials (e.g., copper, PVC, HDPE, etc.), please refer to the relevant standards and specifications from other sources.

ðŸš€ How to Use
-------------

1.  **Open the app** in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
    
2.  **Select a "Nominal Pipe Size"** from the first dropdown menu.
    
3.  The "Schedule Number" dropdown will automatically update with available options for the selected size.
    
4.  **Choose a "Schedule Number"**.
    
5.  **See the results instantly**â€”OD, ID, and Wall Thickness are displayed in inches and mm.
    

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: If a combination is not available in the standards, a pop-up will notify you to check your selection.

ðŸ’» Access the Data Programmatically
-----------------------------------

The complete pipe dimension dataset and the underlying **Python code** used to generate and validate the data are also included in this repository. Feel free to explore, reuse, or integrate the data into your own engineering workflows!
